I believe, you have heard about picture logic puzzles nonograms and solved them. This mission is the opposite: you already have a binary image, formed by strings of equal length, where background empty cell is whitespace and picture cell filled with 'X'.

Your goal is to create a nonogram from the image: write a number clue for solving this image like it was hidden. Your function should return a list of two lists. The first one consists of lists with numbers for columns clue, the second one - the same for rows clue. All lists in columns clue, as well as in rows, should be of same 'depth' (complemented with 0). Let's see all this on example:

example = [' X X ',
           'X X X',
           ' X X ']

Example with solution to see the whole idea:

    columns clue 01010
                 11111
rows clue 0 1 1 ' X X '
          1 1 1 'X X X'
          0 1 1 ' X X '

So, for this example your function should return the following:

nonogram_encode(example) = [[[0, 1, 0, 1, 0],
                             [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]],
                            [[0, 1, 1],
                             [1, 1, 1],
                             [0, 1, 1]]]
# the same, non formatted view
[[[0, 1, 0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]], [[0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]]]

Input: List of strings.

Output: List of 2 lists.
